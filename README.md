My project was on predicting total potential energies of organic molecules with up to four heavy atoms using the ANI-1 model (see my write up and references for explaination of ANI-1).
I fine tuned NN architecture to achieve < 1 kcal/mol accuracy. 
The attached .pdf includes the write up (e.g., methods and results) and all Python code used in the project.
